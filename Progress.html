                        <h5>1. Terrain Classification Algorithm</h5>
                      <p>This module is responsible by Minghui Ni and is completed almost halfway. He has developed a machine learning model which can be used in classification and has been tested as useful for the accuracy as 89.8%. Also, he is very familiar with the following steps of applying this module in the raspberry pi system. </p>
                      <p>Unfortunately, we met some difficulties which will be discussed in the following sections. The result is that the model used now cannot be transferred to the raspberry pi’s platform and we have to use a new model. The accompanying problem is that the dataset we collected now is too small for the new model. Thus, we have just finished the collection of dataset and started writing our new model. </p>
                      <P>If this new model has been trained and finished, the following work will not spend us a lot of time because the prior team created a program which has the similar application with what we are trying to do. </P>
                      <p>Practically speaking, we will finish the model designing in 1-2 weeks and application program in system in 1 week. </p>
                      <h5>2. Android Application</h5>
                      <p>Actually, we didn’t expect the android application has any problems that we need to solve and any need for development because we believe the application developed by the team last year is acceptable. Unfortunately, during the using process of this application, we demonstrated that it is not stable for the application. Also, the original application crashed at the first time we tried to collect data. Thus, we need to redevelop and optimize the app.</p>
                      <p>Now, we have solved the problem of crashing of the original application and we are trying to add some new parts to the application so that we could apply the dynamic terrain threshold to the system.</p>

                      <p>Generally speaking, the key step in process of applying a machine learning classification of TensorFlow in the mobile system is transmitting the existing TF module which has been demonstrated accurate enough to the TensorFlow lite format. After doing that, we could write python program in the mobile system to order the model to classify the input data. </p>
                      <p>Unfortunately, as what I mentioned before, we met difficulties in this step. The difficulties are related to the model saving step in the model training program. The original model is not available for the official transmission tool. Thus, we need to redevelop a new model to fit the requirement of the official transmission tool. </p>
                      <p>Now, we are trying our best to solve this problem and tried to develop the new model and transmitted it into TensorFlow lite format in less than one week.</p>

                      <p>Firstly, our system has been developed by the last cohort, but some functions didn’t work well. For the wireless communication module, due to the long storage time, several devices cannot work correctly. Thus, we need to test all of the components and try to find one whole system which could work. That takes us some time. </p>
                      <p>Secondly, due to the instability of some components, the basic logic of the system was also blocked. For example, at the very beginning, we found that the raw data was never collected and stored in the system of the Raspberry Pi. After we analyzed the program and the status of all components, we found that the GPS module was not working. Because the GPS cannot work correctly, the system’s program was still waiting for the data collected by the GPS to complete collection the first record and it didn’t get the data. That’s why the system couldn’t collect the data correctly. </p>
                      <p>Thirdly, the Android application was also not stable. The Android application we used was based on the last cohort’s achievement. When we were collection vibration data, it crashed totally. Thus, we need to take some other time to fix it.  </p>

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                      <p>At the very beginning, due to the process of fixing all components were not finished, the first constraint we met was actually that the Android application  couldn’t work properly. To start collecting data as early as we could, we changed the mechanism of the inner program from a listener to a timer. By doing this, we could use the system individually without receiving the commands from the Android application</p>
                      <p>For the data collection, the second constraint we met is the timing and weather conditions. Because we need to make sure the system could work well. Our schedule was a little bit late than what we scheduled. However, due to this little change, Flagstaff started being warmer and warmer. That made us really struggle to collect the Snowy data and Rainy data.</p>
                      <p>Thirdly, in order to develop the  machine learning model, we need to collect a large data set of images which contains more than 2000 images for model training. Each image was taken manually and it also met the constraints of the weather conditions. If we didn’t finish that, we could not start working on the machine learning model. </p>

                      <p>The data processing module was aimed at generating a thresholds table for accurate detection of bumps and holes. That application requires that we need to collect accurate vibration data and use them to generate thresholds. However, due to the long storage time, the sensor has drift. Thus, we need to develop a method to decrease the effect caused by the shifting.</p>
                      <p>Secondly, when we were developing the machine learning model, we were stacked on one tiny step, which is transferring the model developed in the TensorFlow platform to the TensorFlow Lite platform. Generally speaking, this step is not difficult, but when we followed the instructions of google, it didn’t work at all. After we made some research and asked for help through the internet, we used another method to transfer it.</p>
                      <p>Thirdly, due to the spread of the covid-19, although we have finished developing the machine learning model, we cannot test it on the real application scene. Thus, the accuracy we offered was just the accuracy in the test data set, which is not so accurate but also representative to evaluate its functionality. </p>
